	Chapter 1 was by far the best season as for many reasons. First, It was at the peak of Fortnite's popularity, and many people were playing it at the time. Another reason is that it is something I grew up with. This may contain bias, but I remember coming home from school and getting on Fortnite with either my friends or my brother. For all of these reasons and more, I think that Chapter 1 is the best season Fortnite has and will ever have. Chapter 1 is the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Fortnite, so that is why it was the best chapter for me.
